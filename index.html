          Nikola Tesla's remarkable intellect and insatiable curiosity paved the
          way for today's technological marvels. His visionary ideas, including
          the alternating current (AC) electrical system, wireless transmission
          of energy, and pioneering work in radio technology, have fundamentally
          reshaped modern civilization. Tesla's ingenuity and foresight continue
          to inspire generations of scientists, engineers, and innovators,
          underscoring the transformative potential of human intellect and the
          boundless possibilities inherent in the pursuit of knowledge.

          <h3>
            Here are some of Nikola Tesla's most impactful inventions with brief
            descriptions of their significance:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="invention-name"> Alternating Current (AC) System: </span>Tesla's development of the AC
              electrical system revolutionized the transmission and distribution
              of electricity, enabling the efficient and widespread delivery of
              power over long distances. This innovation laid the foundation for
              modern electrical grids and made electricity more accessible to
              communities around the world.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="invention-name">Tesla Coil:</span> The Tesla coil is a high-voltage, low-current
              transformer that generates extremely high-frequency alternating
              currents. Its applications range from radio transmission and
              wireless communication to medical devices and scientific research.
              The Tesla coil remains a fundamental component in various fields
              of electrical engineering and physics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="invention-name">Induction Motor:</span> Tesla's invention of the induction motor provided
              a practical and efficient means of converting electrical energy
              into mechanical energy. The induction motor is widely used in
              industrial and commercial applications, including manufacturing,
              transportation, and household appliances. Its development
              contributed to the widespread adoption of electric power in
              industry and everyday life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="invention-name">Wireless Transmission of Energy:</span>Tesla conducted pioneering
              experiments in wireless power transmission, demonstrating the
              feasibility of transmitting electrical energy without the need for
              wires. While his ambitious vision of wireless electricity
              transmission across long distances was not fully realized during
              his lifetime, his work laid the groundwork for subsequent
              developments in wireless communication and power transfer
              technologies.
